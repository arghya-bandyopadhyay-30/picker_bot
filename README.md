## üìå What It Does

This script helps automate recurring team duties‚Äîlike code reviews, deployment ownership, or daily standup anchors‚Äîby:

* Randomly picking one person from your team in a **non-repeating cycle**
* Sending the result to a **Google Chat space** via webhook
* Adding a **programming joke** to lighten the mood
* Providing a **learning resource button** (linked to Refactoring Guru)

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. üì• Add Your Webhook URL

Follow these steps to create a Google Chat webhook URL:

* Open [Google Chat](https://chat.google.com/)
* Select your space ‚Üí Click the **integrations gear icon**
* Choose **"Manage Webhooks"**
* Click **Add Webhook**, name it something like `team_turn_notifier`
* Copy the **Webhook URL** and replace the empty string in the code:

```js
const WEBHOOK_URL = 'https://chat.googleapis.com/....'; // your webhook here
```

---

### 2. üë• Add Team Members

In the `NAMES` array, add all team members' names (make sure they're unique):

```js
const NAMES = [
  "Alice",
  "Bob",
  "Charlie",
  "Diana"
];
```

---

### 3. ‚è∞ Schedule the App

To run it automatically:

1. Open the Apps Script editor
2. Click on `Triggers` from the sidebar
3. Create a new trigger:

   * Choose function: `pickName`
   * Choose deployment: `Head`
   * Select event source: **Time-driven**
   * Select type: **Day timer ‚Üí e.g., Monday at 11:45 AM**

That's it!

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run the App

You can run it manually to test it or wait for the scheduled time:

```js
pickName(); // executes the full message flow
```

---

## üîÑ How to Reset the Cycle

If you'd like to **manually reset** the cycle (e.g., after a break or a team change), run the following function from the Apps Script editor:

```js
resetCycle();
```

This will:

* Clear all previously picked names
* Reset the cycle count back to `1`

You can also:

* Set up a **manual menu item** in the Apps Script UI
* Or create a **trigger to auto-reset** every month/quarter if desired

> üîî Tip: You can run this from the `Run` menu in the script editor or call it from another function as needed.

---

## üìù Customization Notes

* The **card title** is set as: `Code Refactoring - Cycle {n}`
* The **subtitle**: `Next day's pick: {Name}`
* The **button** text: `"Refactor Like a Pro"` links to [refactoring.guru](https://refactoring.guru)

> You can change the text, image, and links in `buildChatCard()` to match your team‚Äôs culture or purpose.
